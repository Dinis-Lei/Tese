\section{Structure of Internet}

The internet is a network of networks, an infrastructure comprised of billions of computers, 
using protocols,\ac{tcp}/\ac{ip} to communicate. 
It is necessary to understand the different layers of the internet to correctly model the 
energy consumption of the network.

Several studies include end-users and datacenters in their models, when studying 
energy comsumption REFS, and while this study will include both we note that the 
separation of both from the network is important, because we aim to
construct a modular model that can remove any component depending on
the use case of whoever uses the model.

\citet{Coroama2015} and \citet{Schien2015} divide the network in 4 layers: \ac{cpe}, access, metro and core.
