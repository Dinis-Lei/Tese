\begin{introduction}
    
    The modelling of the energy consumption of the \ac{ict} sector is a complex task, beacuse it involves modelling several different systems, each with their distinct topologies and external factors.

    In this chapter we can find a descrition of the topology of the different systems that comprise the \ac{ict} sector and an highlight on the main component of each system. Moreover, the chapter also includes a description on the basics of compression algorithms and the different types of compression algorithms.

\end{introduction}

\section{System Boundaries}

The definition of system boundaries is an important factor in the modelling of energy consumption. As seen in the compilation of studies made by \citet{Aslan2018}, the system boundaries is one of the main factors for the discrepancies of the results.

The common consensus is that the system boundaries for the model of the internet should exclude datacenters and user devices \citet{Coroama2014}. This study however won't be modeling only the network but also the impact on datacenters and of the compression/decompression algorithm in the end user device. So the overall system boundary will include all of the \ac{ict} sector. 

As will later be discussed in chapter \ref{chapter:energy_model}, the energy model can be divided in 3 main components, network, datacenters and compression phase.

So the system boundaries for the model is what is shown in figure \ref{fig:system_boundaries}.

\section{Network}

The network is the most complex component of the model. What is defined by network or internet can vary by paper to paper \citet{Aslan2018}. This study uses the definition derived by \citet{Coroama2015}, the network the is the infrastructure that connects two end users. This infrastructure can be divided in 4 main components: \ac{cpe}, access network, edge network and core network.
