   abstract = {Environmental assessments of digital services seeking to take into account the Internet’s energy footprint typically require models of the energy intensity of the Internet. Existing models have arrived at conflicting results. This has lead to increased uncertainty and reduced comparability of assessment results. We present a bottom-up model for the energy intensity of the Internet that draws from the current state of knowledge in the field and is specifically directed towards assessments of digital services. We present the numeric results and explain the application of the model in practice. Complementing the previous chapter that presented a generic approach and results for access networks and customer premise equipment, we present a model to assess the energy intensity of the core networks, yielding the result of 0.052 kWh/GB.},

@article{Ullrich2022,
   abstract = {According to an analysis by the International Energy Agency based on industry data from cisco, the internet protocol (IP) data traffic has more than doubled in 2019 compared to 2016. In addition to an increased number of people and devices with internet access, new trends on the application level can be identified as drivers of this exponential growth. Carsharing, Industry 4.0, or smart home applications are examples of the rising importance of the Internet within new product systems. Therefore, it is indispensable for environmental analyses to account for both, the positive and negative effects of increased internet usage. The existing approaches to account for the resource consumption of information and communication technology (ICT) equipment have different system boundaries or focus exclusively on energy intensity, what offers the basis for further development. This paper provides a new approach for the life cycle assessment of cloud-based services. The presented meta-model accounts for different access technologies and physical topologies. It is based on a literature analysis of bottom-up studies focusing on the energy intensity of the Internet. Furthermore, a new approach is being developed to integrate the carbon intensity of the manufacture of the used network equipment. The meta-model is applied to selected case studies, which reveal the high relevance of customer premise equipment and data centers in the use stage, whereas data centers seem to be the dominating element concerning the manufacturing stage.},

@article{Coroama2015,
   abstract = {Estimates of the energy intensity of the Internet diverge by several orders of magnitude. We present existing assessments and identify diverging definitions of the system boundary as the main reason for this large spread. The decision of whether or not to include end devices influences the result by 1-2 orders of magnitude. If end devices are excluded, customer premises equipment (CPE) and access networks have a dominant influence. Of less influence is the consideration of cooling equipment and other overhead, redundancy equipment, and the amplifiers in the optical fibers. We argue against the inclusion of end devices when assessing the energy intensity of the Internet, but in favor of including CPE, access networks, redundancy equipment, cooling and other overhead as well as optical fibers. We further show that the intensities of the metro and core network are best modeled as energy per data, while the intensity of CPE and access networks are best modeled as energy per time (i.e., power), making overall assessments challenging. The chapter concludes with a formula for the energy intensity of CPE and access networks. The formula is presented both in generic form as well as with concrete estimates of the average case to be used in quick assessments by practitioners. The next chapter develops a similar formula for thecore and edge networks. Taken together, the two chapters provide an assessment method of the Internet’s energy intensity that takes into account different modeling paradigms for different parts of the network.},

@article{Aslan2018,
   abstract = {In order to understand the electricity use of Internet services, it is important to have accurate estimates for the average electricity intensity of transmitting data through the Internet (measured as kilowatt-hours per gigabyte [kWh/GB]). This study identifies representative estimates for the average electricity intensity of fixed-line Internet transmission networks over time and suggests criteria for making accurate estimates in the future. Differences in system boundary, assumptions used, and year to which the data apply significantly affect such estimates. Surprisingly, methodology used is not a major source of error, as has been suggested in the past. This article derives criteria to identify accurate estimates over time and provides a new estimate of 0.06 kWh/GB for 2015. By retroactively applying our criteria to existing studies, we were able to determine that the electricity intensity of data transmission (core and fixed-line access networks) has decreased by half approximately every 2 years since 2000 (for developed countries), a rate of change comparable to that found in the efficiency of computing more generally.},

@article{Baliga2009,
   abstract = {As community concerns about global energy consumption grow, the power consumption of the Internet is becoming an issue of increasing importance. In this paper, we present a network-based model of power consumption in optical IP networks and use this model to estimate the energy consumption of the Internet. The model includes the core, metro and edge, access and video distribution networks, and takes into account energy consumption in switching and transmission equipment. We include a number of access technologies, including digital subscriber line with ADSL2+, fiber to the home using passive optical networks, fiber to the node combined with very high-speed digital subscriber line and point-to-point optical systems. In addition to estimating the power consumption of today's Internet, we make predictions of power consumption in a future higher capacity Internet using estimates of improvements in efficiency in coming generations of network equipment. We estimate that the Internet currently consumes about 0.4\% of electricity consumption in broadband-enabled countries. While the energy efficiency of network equipment will improve, and savings can be made by employing optical bypass and multicast, the power consumption of the Internet could approach 1\% of electricity consumption as access rates increase. The energy consumption per bit of data on the Internet is around 75 J at low access rates and decreases to around 2-4 J at an access rate of 100 Mb/s. © 2009 IEEE.},
