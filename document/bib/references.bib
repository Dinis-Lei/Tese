   abstract = {Storing data in the cloud is becoming a common trend, for both end-customers and data center operators. We propose a method for deciding where to host data storage tasks under the constraint of minimal greenhouse gas emission. The decision on whether to store data locally or store it remotely at a cleaner data center relies on the models for the local and remote data centers and the network connecting them. We conclude that the transport network that connects a local node and a 'cleaner' remote data center plays a significant role in the decision of where to store data, and that the frequency of access of the data is an important and related factor. © 2014 IEEE.},

This paper introduces models to calculate the cost and energy consumption of storage devices for running a variety of workloads, categorized by their dominant requirements. Measurements of two latest hard disk and solid-state drive (SSD) are included to illustrate the models in practice. Contrary to common belief, SSD is not the energy efficient choice for many workloads.},

@article{Shehabi2016,
   abstract = {This report estimates historical data center electricity consumption back to 2000, relying on previous studies and historical shipment data, and forecasts consumption out to 2020 based on new trends and the most recent data available. Figure ES-1 provides an estimate of total U.S. data center electricity use (servers, storage, network equipment, and infrastructure) from 2000-2020. In 2014, data centers in the U.S. consumed an estimated 70 billion kWh, representing about 1.8\% of total U.S. electricity consumption. Current study results show data center electricity consumption increased by about 4\% from 2010-2014, a large shift from the 24\% percent increase estimated from 2005-2010 and the nearly 90\% increase estimated from 2000-2005. Energy use is expected to continue slightly increasing in the near future, increasing 4\% from 2014-2020, the same rate as the past five years. Based on current trend estimates, U.S. data centers are projected to consume approximately 73 billion kWh in 2020.},

@article{Coroama2014,
   abstract = {Assessing the average energy intensity of Internet transmissions is a complex task that has been a controversial subject of discussion. Estimates published over the last decade diverge by up to four orders of magnitude - from 0.0064. kilowatt-hours per gigabyte (kWh/GB) to 136. kWh/GB. This article presents a review of the methodological approaches used so far in such assessments: i) top-down analyses based on estimates of the overall Internet energy consumption and the overall Internet traffic, whereby average energy intensity is calculated by dividing energy by traffic for a given period of time, ii) model-based approaches that model all components needed to sustain an amount of Internet traffic, and iii) bottom-up approaches based on case studies and generalization of the results. Our analysis of the existing studies shows that the large spread of results is mainly caused by two factors: a) the year of reference of the analysis, which has significant influence due to efficiency gains in electronic equipment, and b) whether end devices such as personal computers or servers are included within the system boundary or not. For an overall assessment of the energy needed to perform a specific task involving the Internet, it is necessary to account for the types of end devices needed for the task, while the energy needed for data transmission can be added based on a generic estimate of Internet energy intensity for a given year. Separating the Internet as a data transmission system from the end devices leads to more accurate models and to results that are more informative for decision makers, because end devices and the networking equipment of the Internet usually belong to different spheres of control. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In this article we characterize the power consumption in the different types of networks and discuss strategies to reduce the power consumption. © 2011 IEEE.},
